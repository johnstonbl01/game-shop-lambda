      'WELCOME TO THE ROBOT ACTION! Today we witness the most incredible steel gladiators of this year’s Robot Fighting League season in all their glory and magnificence. The battle robots are gathered in the arena, and the crowd is screaming for some laser-blasting action in this title match. The operators are starting up their control hardware, and we expect nothing but a whole new level of cybernetic devastation. In the end, there will be only one operator to rule the arena... LET THE BATTLE BEGIN! In VOLT, each player takes the role of an operator controlling one robot to challenge other players. By “programming” 3 steps ahead, players try to anticipate the moves of other robots, aim to destroy them, or try to control spaces in the arena that get them victory points. The game includes an easy-to-begin training guide but still leaves experienced players with plenty of different modules to make their robot battles even more exciting and merciless.'
